# MusicStreaming Rewards

## Project Description

MusicStreaming Rewards is a blockchain-based incentive system built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. The platform rewards listeners for discovering new music and promoting artists, creating a token-driven ecosystem that encourages music exploration and artist support. Users earn Music Reward Tokens (MRT) for their engagement activities, fostering a more interactive and rewarding music streaming experience.

The system implements two core reward mechanisms:
- **Music Discovery Rewards**: Users earn 1 MRT when they stream a new song for the first time
- **Artist Promotion Rewards**: Users earn 2 MRT for promoting artists on social platforms or sharing their music

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the music industry by creating a decentralized reward ecosystem that:

- **Empowers Independent Artists**: Provides artists with a direct way to incentivize fans to discover and promote their music
- **Rewards Active Listeners**: Transforms passive music consumption into an engaging, rewarding experience
- **Creates Fair Value Distribution**: Ensures that both listeners and promoters receive tangible rewards for their contributions to artist success
- **Builds Community**: Fosters a community-driven approach to music discovery where everyone benefits from participation
- **Promotes Musical Diversity**: Encourages exploration of diverse genres and independent artists through tokenized incentives

## Future Scope

### Phase 1: Enhanced Reward Mechanisms
- **Tiered Discovery Rewards**: Implement different reward levels based on song popularity or artist status
- **Streak Bonuses**: Reward users for consecutive days of music discovery
- **Genre Exploration Rewards**: Additional tokens for discovering music across different genres

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Expand to multiple streaming platforms and social media networks

- **Artist Funding**: Enable community funding for artists through token-based crowdfunding

### Phase 4: DeFi Integration
